# To-Do

A list of things I want/need to get done on the site

## Required Fixes

- [ ] Fix the bubble animation so that it works properly on Vercel
- [ ] Tinker with the text sizes at each breakpoint a little bit more

## Cool Things

- [ ] Load-in Animations
    - [ ] Name should fade in with a small drop from above
    - [ ] Have the subtitle under the name be randomized with a spinner animation. Give the user the ability to re-roll it.
