# To-Do

A list of things I want/need to get done on the site

## Required Fixes

- [ ] Tinker with the text sizes at each breakpoint a little bit more
- [ ] Fix the weird event where the drag circle just stays in the upper left corner for some reason
- [ ] Put in Containers that have maximum sizes based on viewport so that I don't have to handle that many breakpoints

## Cool Things

- [ ] Load-in Animations
- [ ] Get the symbols in from [Haikei](https://app.haikei.app/) to use as a cool 80's theme

## Finished Fixes

- [x] Fix the bubble animation so that it works properly on Vercel

### Abondoned Changes
    - [x] Have the subtitle under the name be randomized with a spinner animation. Give the user the ability to re-roll it.
