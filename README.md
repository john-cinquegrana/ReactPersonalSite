This repository contains teh code for my personal website which is currently hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) at [john-cinquegrana.com](https://www.john-cinquegrana.com/). This website was created as a general *About Me* showcase of my current life and projects. It was created using the following technologies:
- **Vite** as a build tool and dev runner
- **Node.js** as the packaging and runtime
- **Typescript** as a better alternative to Javascript
- **React** as the frontend framework
- **MUI** as the major component library

## Deployment Pattern

Currently the **Vercel** deployment is set up to track the **main** branch. Any commits, merges, or pushes to the **main** branch will cause a new deployment on the **Vercel** domain.

All development work should be done on the **nightly** branch. This branch, as of current, has no associated actions.
